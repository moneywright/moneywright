Moneywright uses AI to categorize transactions, detect subscriptions, and power the chat assistant. You bring your own API key — your data goes directly to your chosen provider, never through Moneywright servers.

When you first open Moneywright, you'll be asked to configure at least one AI provider before you can start using the app.

|----------|----------------|------------------|
| **Vercel AI Gateway** | Best choice — access all providers with one API key | Easy |
| **Google Gemini** | Great results with good pricing | Easy |
| **OpenAI** | Excellent quality | Medium (requires identity verification) |

- For best performance: Apple Silicon Mac or dedicated GPU

### Install Ollama

2. Install and run Ollama
3. Pull a model:

```bash
# Recommended for most users
ollama pull llama3.2

# Smaller, faster model
ollama pull llama3.2:1b

# Larger, more capable (needs 16GB+ RAM)
ollama pull llama3.1:70b
```

### Add to Moneywright

1. Make sure Ollama is running (`ollama serve`)
2. Open Moneywright settings
3. Go to **AI Providers**
4. Enable **Ollama**
5. The default URL is `http://localhost:11434`
6. Select your installed model

<Callout type="warn">
**Performance note:** Local models are slower than cloud APIs and may produce lower quality categorization. For the best experience, we recommend using a cloud provider.

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API key"

- Make sure you copied the entire key
- Check that you're using the right provider's key
- Verify the key hasn't been revoked
- For OpenAI/Anthropic: ensure you've added funds to your account

### "Rate limit exceeded"

- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Add more credits to your account
- Switch to a different provider

### "Insufficient credits"

- Add funds to your provider account
- Switch to Vercel AI Gateway or Google Gemini (easier billing setup)

### Ollama not connecting

- Make sure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
- Check the URL is correct (default: `http://localhost:11434`)
- Verify you've pulled at least one model: `ollama list`
