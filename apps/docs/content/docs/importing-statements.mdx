Moneywright reads your bank statements and extracts every transaction automatically. If your bank gives you a PDF or CSV, Moneywright can import it.

## Supported Formats

| Format | Support |
|--------|---------|
| **PDF** | Bank statements, credit card statements, investment reports |
| **CSV** | Transaction exports from most banks |
| **Excel (.xlsx)** | Spreadsheet exports |

## How to Import

1. Open Moneywright
2. Go to **Statements**
3. Drag your file onto the upload area, or click to browse
4. Wait for AI to process the statement

You can import multiple statements at once by selecting multiple files.

## Bank Statements (PDF)

Most banks provide monthly statements as PDFs. Moneywright's AI reads these and extracts:

- Transaction date
- Description/merchant name
- Amount (debit or credit)
- Running balance (if shown)

### Tips for Best Results

- **Use official statements** — Download directly from your bank's website or app
- **Avoid scanned documents** — OCR quality varies; digital PDFs work best
- **Password-protected PDFs** — Remove the password before uploading, or enter it when prompted

## CSV Exports

CSV files are the most reliable format. Most banks let you export transactions as CSV.

### How to Export from Your Bank

Look for "Export", "Download", or "Statement" options in your online banking. Most banks support CSV export.

**Common locations:**
- Account Statement → Download → CSV
- Transaction History → Export
- Reports → Download Statement

## Credit Card Statements

Credit card statements work the same as bank statements:

1. Download your monthly statement PDF from your card issuer
2. Import into Moneywright
3. Transactions are categorized automatically

---

## After Import

Once your statement is imported:

### Automatic Categorization

AI categorizes each transaction into categories like Food & Dining, Shopping, Transportation, Bills & Utilities, and 40+ more.

### Review and Correct

1. Go to **Transactions**
2. Review the auto-assigned categories
3. Click any transaction to change its category
4. Your corrections help improve future categorization

### Subscription Detection

Moneywright automatically identifies recurring charges like monthly subscriptions and recurring bills. View all detected subscriptions in the **Subscriptions** tab.

## Troubleshooting

### "Could not parse statement"

- Try exporting as CSV instead of PDF
- Make sure it's a transaction statement (not an account summary)
- Check if the PDF is password-protected

### Duplicate Transactions

Moneywright detects and skips exact duplicates automatically. If you're seeing duplicates, the transactions may have slight differences — you can merge or delete them manually.

### Wrong Categories

Categories are AI-generated and may need correction:

1. Click the transaction
2. Select the correct category
3. Optionally create a rule: "Always categorize [merchant] as [category]"
